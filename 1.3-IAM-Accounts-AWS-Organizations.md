## 1.3.1 IAM Identity Policies

An IAM Identity Policy is a set of Security Statements to AWS.
- Grants access or denies access to AWS products or features to any identity
  that uses those products.

Policy documents made up of array of statements with the form:
- Sid: Optional Identifier of the resource
- Effect: "Allow" or "Deny" which controls the access policy of the statement.
- Action: Actions can match 1:m actions. Can be specific (`s3:OPERATION`) or
  can match wildcard operations (`s3:*`)
- Resource: array of resources, can be specific or wildcard.

Order of IAM Policy priority:
1. Explicit **DENY**
1. Explicit **ALLOW**
1. Default **DENY** (Implicit)

These are applied across the board, no matter how many policies match the
identity.

### Policy Types

- Inline Policies
  - Applied on individual identities.
  - Not best practice, doesn't scale.
  - Should be used for special or exceptional allow/deny
- Managed Policies
  - Configured policy rules that are reusable and have low management overhead.
